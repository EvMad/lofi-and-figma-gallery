            <h2>Case Study: Record Launcher</h2>
            <p>This project began with a simple prompt: "Design an album pre-order app for a Punk band."</p>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The initial idea behind the <i>Record Launcher</i> application was to provide a single digital space where artists could plan an album pre-order campaign, organize tasks, store digital assets for promotional purposes, and keep track of orders for shipping.  The app would also provide optional paid services, such as album manufacturing, design, merch printing, and shipping, for one-stop-shopping. </p><br>
            <p>Following through with ideation, one thought was to make the calendar feature the central component of the application.  If the user made every decision about their album campaign through the lens of setting one main goal (the release date,) with a series of mini goals along the way (promotional tasks,) beginning with a defined starting point (the pre-sale campaign launch,) then theoretically everything else would fall into place.</p><br>
            <p>Moving into the first prototype and the first usability study, it became clear that the application was vague and that users didn’t have a clear happy path.  The app had too many extraneous features and no clear MVP.</p><br>

            <p><span class="userName">Damien Curtis:</span> Damien started out as an ambitious, yet somewhat naive, young person with the singular goal of leading a successful band. After over a decade of DIY touring with several bands, Damien is ready to work smarter not harder to produce, promote, and distribute music.</p><br>
            <p><span class="userName">Charlotte Brinks:</span> Charlotte has managed several successful bands over the years, even bringing one up to the level of a fairly big label with great distribution. She landed a job at a big agency through proving herself in coming up through the DIY scene. Charlotte now navigates both worlds for a roster of artists.</p><br>

            <h3>Usability</h3>
            <p>The general consensus amongst the first usability study participants was that the app’s functionality was confusing even if the purpose was clear. The user flow needed to be refined and pain points removed.  The second iteration of the application would need to be stripped down to the minimum viable product, and every click path would need a clear resolution in the second prototype. Below is an image of the intital screens of the original low-fidelity prototype:</p><br>
