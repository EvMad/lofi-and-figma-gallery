            <h2>Case Study: Record Launcher</h2>
            <p>This project began with a simple prompt: "Design an album pre-order app for a Punk band."</p>
        </div>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The initial idea behind the <i>Record Launcher</i> application was to provide a single digital space where artists could plan an album pre-order campaign, organize tasks, store digital assets for promotional purposes, and keep track of orders for shipping.  The app would also provide optional paid services, such as album manufacturing, design, merch printing, and shipping, for one-stop-shopping. </p><br>
            <p>This project began in early March 2022, and continued throughout the summer.  Evan Madden is both the UX Researcher and Designer.  Evan works full time as a web developer and conducts UX research during free time.</p><br>
            <p>Following through with ideation, one thought was to make the calendar feature the central component of the application.  If the user made every decision about their album campaign through the lens of setting one main goal (the release date,) with a series of mini goals along the way (promotional tasks,) beginning with a defined starting point (the pre-sale campaign launch,) then theoretically everything else would fall into place.</p><br>
            <p>Moving into the first prototype and the first usability study, it became clear that the application was vague and that users didn’t have a clear happy path.  The app had too many extraneous features and no clear MVP.</p><br>

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>The research goals were to determine key features, to determine how those features integrate into user's existing workflow, to improve workflow, and to improve album sales.</p><br>
            <p>Usability studies were conducting with both paper and digital prototypes, with 5-7 participants per study.</p><br>
            <p><span class="userName">Problem Statement:</span>"The user is a DIY musician, who needs an app to organize all aspects of promoting an album pre-sale, because between working, writing, and rehearsing, there is not a lot of time for public relations."</p>

            <h3>Usability</h3>
            <p>The general consensus amongst the first usability study participants was that the app’s functionality was confusing even if the purpose was clear. The user flow needed to be refined and pain points removed.  The second iteration of the application would need to be stripped down to the minimum viable product, and every click path would need a clear resolution in the second prototype. Below is an image of the intital screens of the original low-fidelity prototype:</p><br>
            <img src="./assets/images/RL_v1_Figma.png" alt="lo-fi figma prototype" class="images" /><br>
            <p>And here is an image of an iteration from after the first usability study:</p><br>
            <img src="./assets/images/RL_Mock_7.png" alt="hi-fi figma prototype" class="images"/><br>
            <p>The primary pain points during the first iteration's usability studies were that somes users were uncertain of the main function of the app, and that some features seemed extraneous.  The second iteration included fewer features, a more focused MVP, and complete click-paths for all app features. The optional services were scrapped in order to serve the MVP.</p><br>

     <!--takeaways begin-->
     <div class="container">
        <div class="usability" id="takeaways">
            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <p>The key takeaway was to keep the product streamlined, because the original purpose of the app was to save the user time and to keep the album pre-order process as smooth and painless as possible. This goal could be better achieved with a "calendar-centric" design, with all other functions rooted in the calendar, including the upload fields.</p><br>
            <h4>Accessibility Considerations</h4>
            <p>The first accessibility pain point was caused by a contrast issue with the app's color scheme.  It became clear that the screens needed to be designed with a single color over a white background, rather than a color on color. From there, decisions regarding text and hierarchy were made in order to make the application more accessible and properly organized for screen readers.</p><br>
